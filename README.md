# Zuzanna's Cooper Test Challenge
## at CraftAcademy bootcamp week 2

**Assignment**

The challenge is to build a JavaScript-based program that makes the calculation, based on a person's gender, age and performance in order to get an assessment of the aerobic endurance, according to the Cooper Normative Data Table.

**Installation instructions**

1. Create a new cooper_challenge directory and add folders: lib, spec and src to that directory
2. Download jasmine-2.8.0 and put it into the lib folder
3. Add SpecRunner.html into the root folder

**How to build the application**

1. Create a cooper_spec.js file in the spec folder and add tests that cover the user story:

* As an athlete, in order to get to know my results from the Cooper test I want to be able to input my distance and get a result from the normative data table

2. Create a cooper.js file in the src folder and implement code that covers test specs
3. Add both files to the SpecRunner.html file

**How to run the application**

1. Open the SpecRunner.html (or any other browser window)
2. Right-click and choose Inspect
3. Switch to the Console tab and run the application from there
